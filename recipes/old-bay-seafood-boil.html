        lover. Enjoy in the summertime or pull this recipe out on Christmas and take time to relax with the family.

       <li>3 pounds medium red potatoes, cut in 1/2</li> 
       <li>5 (13 ounce) packages smoked kielbasa sausage, cut into 2-inch pieces</li> 
       <li>6 ears sweet corn, halved</li> 
       <li>30 littleneck clams, scrubbed</li> 
       <li>4 pounds jumbo shrimp, deveined, tail on</li> 
       <li>2 ½ pounds Alaskan king crab legs</li> 
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>

    <ol>
        <li>Fill a very large stockpot fitted with a basket insert with about 8 quarts of water, or about halfway full. Squeeze lemons into the water, tossing the halves in too. Add onions, chiles, garlic, thyme, seafood seasoning, kosher salt, and bay leaves; bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat and simmer for 10 minutes. </li>
        <li>Stir potatoes into the pot and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Next, add sausage and corn; cook another 5 minutes, making sure everything stays covered with the liquid.</li>
        <li>Add clams and boil until they open, about 8 minutes. Toss in shrimp and shut off the heat. Cover the pot and let shrimp steep in the flavor for 10 minutes, adding crab in the last 5 minutes (press them into the liquid).</li>
        <li>Drain and spread crab, shrimp, sausage, clams, corn, potatoes, and onions out on a newspaper-covered table or on three large serving trays. Sprinkle with a dusting of Old Bay or provide for individual use.</li>

    </ol>
